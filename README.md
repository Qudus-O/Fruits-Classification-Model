# Fruit-Classification-Model
This project utilizes two datasets:

## Beans Plant Dataset

The bean leaves dataset was collected and prepared by the [Makerere AI Lab](https://air.ug/dataset-details/2/) and the National Crops Resources Institute (NaCRRI) in Uganda. As the son of a farmer, I understand how tedious it can be to check on crop leaves daily to assess their health.

We will develop a classifier to accurately predict whether the leaves of a bean plant are diseased or healthy. This innovation could help farmers in Uganda achieve a relatively high crop yield.

## Fruits 360 Dataset

[The Fruits 360](https://github.com/fruits-360) dataset was compiled by researchers Horea Muresan and Mihai Oltean. It contains over 90,000 images of fruits and vegetables across 131 classes, with each image measuring 100Ã—100 pixels.

## Model Architecture

Both models were built using Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) and pre-trained models.
